// This is a client-side only implementation of mermaid, which is its primary development target.
// https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/using-client-side-only-packages/
// Server side rendering mermaid diagrams is technically possible
// and some remark and gatsby plugins do it. But all are badly maintained
// and the server side rendering use case is not covered in the mermaid documentation,
// which makes it a hard to maintain architecture.
// server side rendering also has the disadvantage that clickable elements cannot
// work because this requires attaching event handlers.
