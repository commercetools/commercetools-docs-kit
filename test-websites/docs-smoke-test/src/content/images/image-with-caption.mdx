shortTitle: Image Caption Test

Images can have a caption like the above. It's authored by setting the `title` using the markdown notation
`![image of a cat](../../images/cat.png "Cats are a fully supported feature of the Scala programming language")`.
The "image of a cat" `alt` text of the image is not used as a caption but remains what it's intended for - a fallback text for screen readers or if the image fails to load.

![the image alt text goes here](../../images/full-resolution-photo.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption')
