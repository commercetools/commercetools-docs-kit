Allow multiple GA tracking IDs by using gtag.js

To migrate, rename the `gaTrackingId` theme configuration to `gaTrackingIds` and pass an array of strings.
The previous configuration is still supported for compatibility.
Find the new IDs for commercetools docs in the docs-kit documentation including the new GA4 id.
