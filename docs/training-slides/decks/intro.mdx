# Documentation Types (TODO make this cards)

<Horizontal>

1. **Reference**:

- Conceptual definitions
- Behavior definitions - what math does the cart exactly do? How does the search exactly rank?
- Data field semantics - what's the domain intent of that property?
- Interface surfaces (HTTP API surface, GraphQL schema, Java / PHP / etc)

1. **Guides / Tutorials / The Book / HowTos**

- Step-By Step reproducible
- Can take side paths and alternative ways (Guide & HowTo) or not (Tutorial)

1. **Product Marketing / Tech Evangelism**

- not documentation in the strict sense but important
- short-lived, not updated or maintained
- can be sales-y, can make temporal references (for example "our recently launched feature FooBar")
