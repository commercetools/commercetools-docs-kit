# Markdown Code Formatting

Goals:

- Make it a non-topic, invest our time into thinking about content
- Eliminate non-content changes in git. Easier to review and more transparent.

Solution:

- Content lives in a separate Repository than the site implementation (kit)
- "Prettier," an deterministic automated code formatter.
  Every time you save or commit, markdown is be completely reformatted without any configurability
- Some optional conventions that reduce the "git noise" further
  - Start a new line on every new sentence
