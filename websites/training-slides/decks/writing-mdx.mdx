# Markdown - the missing parts

Markdown is great. Until you need elements that are not specified.

- Info / Warning / Error Boxes
- Subtitles
- Code examples loaded from files
- Multi language code examples
- Asides
- Definition Lists
- ...

Markdown's spec allows you to insert arbitrary HTML, allowing you to do _anything_, which is not a good idea.

# MDX = Markdown + Custom UI Components

TODO compare MD + HTML vs. MDX

# Component: Info / Warn / Error
