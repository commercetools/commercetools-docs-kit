  Each item shipping target determines the address (as a reference to an address in `itemShippingAddresses`) 
  and the quantity that should be shipped to this address. Should multiple shipping addresses be needed 
  for one (custom) line item, sub-quantities are specified. Thus, an array of addresses and sub-quantities 
  is stored per (custom) line item. Upon order creation, the sum of sub-quantities must add up to the 
  total quantity of the (custom) line item.
