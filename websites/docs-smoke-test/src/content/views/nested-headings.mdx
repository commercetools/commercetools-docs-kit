## L2 Subsection 2.2 (deep)

This Subsection contains a number of Level 4 to 6 Sub-Subsections as they would be used in API documentation to hold long lists of data interfaces that may or may not be structurally nested in themselves. Such content often has no nesting inside it, but for smoke testing this page shows the maximum possible nesting.

The navigation component below  is intended to be used for long lists of subsections like update actions or type declarations. It's created this way:

```jsx
<ChildSectionsNav parent="l2-subsection-22-deep"/>
```

<ChildSectionsNav parent="l2-subsection-22-deep"/>
