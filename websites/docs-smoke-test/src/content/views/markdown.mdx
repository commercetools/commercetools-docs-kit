This page gives an overview of different markdown elements and how they fit together.
Custom React components **embedded in the markdown** can also support markdown syntax.

# A section header

## A beta section <Beta />

The `<Beta />` tag can be used inline <Beta /> and should be applied self-closing

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

Second paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, **_italic bold_**, ~~strikethrough~~, and `monospace`.

### Line Break

The backslash, `\`, is interpreted as a new line.\
This sentence should appear on a new line.

## List items

import ListItems from "../../topics/list-items.mdx"

<ListItems />

## Blockquotes

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Blockquotes can be nested (that is a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of >:

> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:

import ComplexBlockQuote from "../../topics/complex-blockquote.mdx"

<ComplexBlockQuote />

## Subsection (first level)

## Lists

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Here's a nested ordered list:

1. Step 1
   1. Sub-step 1
   2. Sub-step 2
      1. Sub Sub-step 1
      2. Sub Sub-step 2
2. Step 2

Here's a definition list:

<Dl>
  <Dt>

`Healthy`

  </Dt>
  <Dd>The subscription is delivering messages as expected</Dd>
  <Dt>

`ConfigurationError`

  </Dt>
  <Dd>

Messages can not be delivered with the current configuration. If the configuration is fixed in this health status,
all messages that havenâ€™t been delivered yet will still be delivered and the status will change to `Healthy`.

`ConfigurationError`s are automatically turned into `ConfigurationErrorDeliveryStopped` after some time. See the [Delivery Guarantees](#last-section) section for more details.

  </Dd>
  <Dt>

`ConfigurationErrorDeliveryStopped`

  </Dt>
  <Dd>

Messages can not be delivered with the current configuration and delivery of those is not attempted anymore.
Undelivered messages are not retained and will not be delivered if the configuration is fixed in this status, but the status will change to `Healthy`
as soon as new messages can be delivered successfully again.

  </Dd>
  <Dt>Something else</Dt>
  <Dd>Yet something else</Dd>
</Dl>

### Subsection (second level)

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

    ```
    find wooden spoon
    uncover pot
    stir
    cover pot
    balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
    wait 10 minutes
    goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
    ```

    > Do not bump wooden spoon or it falls.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3).

## Code blocks

Note that code blocks created by indenting content by 4 spaces (4 characters
from the left side) are **not** supported and will **not** work as expected.

The only supported way to create code blocks is by using delimited blocks, where you can
specify syntax highlight:

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(5, 2));
```

## Links

Here's a link to [a website](https://commercetools.com), to a [local doc](/components/images), and to a [section heading in the current doc](#last-section). Here's a footnote [^1].
