title: Lead Content and Subtitle
---

<Subtitle>
  This text is the "Subtitle." It's to be authored by using a custom element
  component in MDX. It cannot yet contain Formatting.
</Subtitle>

All other content before the first section heading is considered the "lead" content.
It is an introduction to the topic of the page - don't use heading names like "Overview" or "Introduction," just write this content as the lead.
It's formatted like regular body content and can technically contain any body content using any markdown formatting like the following:

This is a plain paragraph. _bold_ stuff there. Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus,
its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a [I am an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus,
its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text Plus, its a long text.

# First Heading Denotes the End of the Lead

The Lead ends implicitly with a Heading of any Level.
The spacing between the first Heading and the Lead is a bit higher than among other body content and a Heading.

# Subtitle Syntax

```
<Subtitle>
  This text is the "Subtitle." It's to be authored by using a custom element
  component in MDX. It cannot yet contain Formatting.
</Subtitle>
```

For "Interleaving" markdown formatting into components this is the specification request: https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/628.
It's based on this detail of the CommonMark spec: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#example-137

If it works the syntax is as follows (note the empty lines! )

```
<Subtitle>

  This text is the "Subtitle." It's to be authored by using a custom element
  component in MDX. It can contain **formatting**.

</Subtitle>
```
