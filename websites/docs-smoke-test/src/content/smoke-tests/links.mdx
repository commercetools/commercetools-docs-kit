- href: `/smoke-tests/links/#last-heading`.
- jump to that position without visible scrolling or reload

Here's a

- href: `https://docs.commercetools.com/test/smoke-tests/links/#last-heading`.
- will render as an outbound link, no "smart" detection

- href: `https://docs.commercetools.com/test/api/types/`.
- will render as an outbound link, no "smart" detection

Here's a

- should be a GatsbyLink -> in-app transition

Here's a

- [Link to another page on this site with a specific anchor a page on this site](/#linked-from-links)
- href: `/#linked-from-links`.
- should be a GatsbyLink -> in-app transition and direct jump to that position.

Here's a

- [Link to another page on this site using a relative upwards traversal path](../)
- href: `../`.
- should be a GatsbyLink to `/smoke-tests/` -> in-app transition

Here's a

- [Link to a page path-wise "below" to this one, in a relative fashion (omitting the trailing slash)](link-target)
- href: `link-target`.
- should be a GatsbyLink to `/smoke-tests/links/link-target`-> in-app transition

Here's a

- href: `/../import-api/`
- should be a plain `<a>`tag / html-link

## Link use cases that detect logically addressed API elements

TODO these need to be migrated over to the API docs test site.

These would typically appear in RAML description texts, but using this addressing in MD(X) content can also be helpful when refactoring a site's structure.

**NOT YET TO BE SUPPORTED:** Here's a [Link pointing a URN style location of a type definition that is actually on this site]() - `ctp:test:type:UnionLikeType`. It should transition to the definition of that type and be rendered as the type name "UnionLikeType".

**NOT YET TO BE SUPPORTED:** Here's a [Link pointing a URN style location of a type definition that isn't actually on this site]() - `ctp:test:type:UnionLikeType`. It should render no link but just the type name as a text span. (TODO better as a code span?)

**NOT YET TO BE SUPPORTED:** Here's a [Link pointing a URN style location of an endpoint definition that is actually on this site]() - `ctp:test:endpoint:/{projectKey}/resource/{id}:GET`. It should transition to the definition of that endpoint and be rendered as "GET /{projectKey}/resource/{id}" (TODO a code formatting or plain text?).

## Last Heading

This paragraph just serves as a link target. The Anchor ID should be `#last-heading`
