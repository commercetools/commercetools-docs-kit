Blockquotes are to be used for actual quotes, for example of external documents like specifications or verbal statements.
Do not use the for information "boxes" (see below).

> "Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> You need to add the quotation marks as part of the content so you can denote the source inside the quote.
> You can set them in multiple lines in the markdown source." (John Doe, famous tech writer)

Technically Blockquotes can be nested but we should not render that or ignore if it looks bad:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>   _Everything_ is going according to **plan**.
