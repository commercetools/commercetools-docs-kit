title: Markdown and Content Smoketest Page

Definition Lists are not part of the standard markdown syntax but we often need them in documentation.
There is a syntax used in this page which is nonstandard but implemented in some parsers (but not available in remark)

First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.
: Unless we install a special plugin this will be just body text with colons in it.

Second Term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.

Syntax:

```md
First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.
: Unless we install a special plugin this will be just body text with colons in it.

Second Term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.
```
