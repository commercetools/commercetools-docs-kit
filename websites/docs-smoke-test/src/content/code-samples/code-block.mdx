The following block-level code samples must be

- correctly syntax highlighted
- have line numbering
- have a copy button
- do not have a header bar because they don't have a title and are single-language

### Terminal/Console

"terminal" or "console" samples should

- have a command prompt
- wrap lines but indent the second line so it's visually clearer that it's the same line
- syntax highlight as bash / sh.
- if not prompt lines are explicitly configured, all lines are prompt lines (i.e. no output included)

```console noPromptLines=3-4
cd project
cp -R \
  dist \
  public/
rm -rf dist
yarn start
```

Typical tutorial like two-step sequence:

```console noPromptLines=1,3
# fetch a token:
curl https://auth.sphere.io/oauth/token --basic --user "{client_id}:{client_secret}" -X POST -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=manage_project:{project_key}"
# now access the API:
curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.sphere.io/PROJECT_KEY/products
```
