title: Docs Kit Release Notes Test
# TODO frontmatter to instruct that this is a release note layout? or MDX imports?
---

<Subtitle>Custom content above the Release notes is needed for per site customization</Subtitle>

To stay informed about the latest releases subscribe to the RSS feed (TODO RSS would be better e.g. in the top right corner?) or sign up for the (test product newsletter)[https://example.com].

<Warn>TODO how to put it here? Can this automatically trigger the filter in the sidebar or would we have to explicitly instruct the layout via frontmatter to not render the index nav??</Warn>

`<ReleaseNotes />`
