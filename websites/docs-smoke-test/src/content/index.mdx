title: Full page example of markdown elements
beta: true

<Subtitle>

This page gives an overview of different markdown elements and how they fit together.
Custom React components **embedded in the markdown** can also support markdown syntax, as long as there are **empty lines** between the component tag and the content.

</Subtitle>

# A section header

## A beta section <Beta />

The `<Beta />`  tag can be used inline <Beta /> and should be applied self-closing

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

Line breaks are expressed with a backslash\
(before this) at the end of the line.

Second paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, **_italic and bold_**, ~~strikethrough~~ and `monospace`.

## List items

Itemized lists look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

## Blockquotes

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Blockquotes can be nested (that is a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of >:

> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:

> ## This is a header.
>
> 1.  This is the first list item.
> 2.  This is the second list item.
>
> Here's some example code:
>
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... are converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

## Subsection (first level)

## Lists

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Here's a definition list:

<dl>
  <dt>

`Healthy`

  </dt>
  <dd>The subscription is delivering messages as expected</dd>
  <dt>

`ConfigurationError`

  </dt>
  <dd>

Messages can not be delivered with the current configuration. If the configuration is fixed in this health status,
all messages that haven’t been delivered yet will still be delivered and the status will change to `Healthy`.

`ConfigurationError`s are automatically turned into `ConfigurationErrorDeliveryStopped` after some time. See the [Delivery Guarantees](#last-section) section for more details.

  </dd>
  <dt>

`ConfigurationErrorDeliveryStopped`

  </dt>
  <dd>

Messages can not be delivered with the current configuration and delivery of those is not attempted anymore.
Undelivered messages are not retained and will not be delivered if the configuration is fixed in this status, but the status will change to `Healthy`
as soon as new messages can be delivered successfully again.

  </dd>
  <dt>Something else</dt>
  <dd>Yet something else</dd>
</dl>

### Subsection (second level)

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    > Do not bump wooden spoon or it falls.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3).

## Code blocks

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, where you can
specify syntax highlight (**highly recommended**):

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(5, 2));
```

## Links

Here's a link to [a website](https://commercetools.com), to a [local doc](components/images), and to a [section heading in the current doc](#last-section). Here's a footnote [^1].

## Tables

Tables can look like this:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
| ------------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Hello         |     short      |         $1600 |
| World         |    content     |           $12 |
| zebra stripes | avoid insects  |            $1 |

or taking the full width:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned | Right Aligned | This right aligned content is a long content that extends to the edge of the screen |
| ------------- | :------------: | ------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Centered cell |    Content     |       Content |                                                                             Content |
| Content       |    Content     |       Content |                                                                             Content |
| Content       |    Content     |  Centered cell |                                                                             Content |
