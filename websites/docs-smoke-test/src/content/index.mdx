title: Full page example of markdown elements

<Subtitle>

This page gives an overview of different markdown elements and how they fit together.
Custom React components **embedded in the markdown** can also support markdown syntax, as long as there are **empty lines** between the component tag and the content.

# A section header

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, **_italic and bold_**, ~~strikethrough~~ and `monospace`.

## List items

Itemized lists look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

## Blockquotes

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of >:

> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:

> ## This is a header.
>
> 1.  This is the first list item.
> 2.  This is the second list item.
>
> Here's some example code:
>
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º

## Subsection (1st level)

## Lists

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Here's a definition list:

<dl>
  <dt>apples</dt>
  <dd>Good for making applesauce.</dd>
  <dt>oranges</dt>
  <dd>Citrus!</dd>
  <dt>tomatoes</dt>
  <dd>There's no "e" in tomatoe.</dd>
</dl>

### Subsection (2nd level)

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    > Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

## Code blocks

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, where you can
specify syntax highlight (**highly recommended**):

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(5, 2));
```

## Links

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local doc](../images/image), and to a [section heading in the current doc](#a-section-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

## Tables

Tables can look like this:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
| ------------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Hello         |     short      |        \$1600 |
| World         |    content     |          \$12 |
| zebra stripes | avoid insects  |           \$1 |

or taking the full width:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned | Right Aligned | This right aligned content is a long content that extends to the edge of the screen |
| ------------- | :------------: | ------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Centered cell |    Content     |       Content |                                                                             Content |
| Content       |    Content     |       Content |                                                                             Content |
| Content       |    Content     |  Centred cell |                                                                             Content |

## Horizontal rules

**We don't style horizontal rules.**
