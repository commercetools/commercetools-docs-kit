title: Mermaid Diagrams
---

It's possible to generate Mermaid Diagrams by either placing the Mermaid code into `<Mermaid>...</Mermaid>` components or by placing a code block with language `mermaid`.
The fenced code block has the advantage that there are VSCode plugins that provide syntax highlighting and previews.

# A Sequence Diagram

```mermaid

  Note over HCP API: Formerly known as CTP
  CFP->>+HCP API: Add this to the Cart

  HCP API->>+Extension Server: New cart would be this. Okay?
  Extension Server-->>-HCP API: OK, but change this before returning!
  HCP API-->>-CFP: Cool, here's your new Cart
  alt For comparison without extension
  CFP->>+HCP API: A change that has not extension configured
  HCP API-->>-CFP: I #9829; you, here's your new resource
  end
```
