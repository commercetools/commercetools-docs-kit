  participant HCP API
  participant Extension Server
  Note over HCP API: Formerly known as CTP
  CFP->>+HCP API: Add this to the Cart
  HCP API->>+HCP API: Do but don't persist yet
  HCP API->>+Extension Server: New cart would be this. Okay?
  Extension Server-->>-HCP API: OK, but change this before returning!
  HCP API-->>-CFP: Cool, here's your new Cart
  alt For comparison without extension
  CFP->>+HCP API: A change that has not extension configured
  HCP API-->>-CFP: I #9829; you, here's your new resource
