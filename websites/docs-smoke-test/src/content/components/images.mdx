# With caption

Images can have a caption. It's authored by setting the `title` using the markdown notation.

![the image alt text goes here](/images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption')

# Without caption

Images without a title do not have a caption.

![the image alt text goes here](/images/1200x300.jpg)

# SVG

SVG Images are not handled by Gatsby but should still be properly rendered.

![the image alt text goes here](/content/files/svg-with-transparent-background.svg 'this is the title')

SVG Images have similar spacing behavior as images that are handled by Gatsby. There should also always be spacing on the left and right side of the image.

![the image alt text goes here](/content/files/svg-with-full-width.svg 'this is the title')

# Small size

Images with a small size are _not recommended_ to be used.

# Big height

Images with a big height are _not recommended_ to be used.

# Inline content

The following image is embedded into a body text paragraph.

The Image is after this text ![the image alt text goes here](/images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption') and before this text.

# External image

External images are _not recommended_ to be used but they should work as well and somehow do not look ugly.
