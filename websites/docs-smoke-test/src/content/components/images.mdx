# With caption

Images can have a caption. It's authored by setting the `title` using the markdown notation.

![the image alt text goes here](/images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption')

# Without caption

Images without a title do not have a caption.

![the image alt text goes here](/images/1200x300.jpg)

# SVG

SVG Images are not handled by Gatsby but should still be properly rendered.

![the image alt text goes here](/content/files/svg-with-transparent-background.svg 'this is the title')

# Small size

Images with a small size are _not recommended_ to be used.

# Inline content

The following image is embedded into a body text paragraph.

The Image is after this text ![the image alt text goes here](/images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption') and before this text.

# External image

External images are _not recommended_ to be used but they should work as well and somehow do not look ugly.
