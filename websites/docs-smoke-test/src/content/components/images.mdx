# With caption

Images can have a caption like the above. It's authored by setting the `title` using the markdown notation.

```
![the image alt text goes here](../../images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption')
```

![the image alt text goes here](../../images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption')

# Without caption

```
![the image alt text goes here](../../images/1200x300.jpg)
```

![the image alt text goes here](../../images/1200x300.jpg)

# SVG

SVG Images are not handled by the Gatsby Image Processing Pipeline but should still be rendered in an acceptably styled and positioned way.

```
![the image alt text goes here](../files/svg-with-transparent-background.svg 'this is the title')
```

![the image alt text goes here](../files/svg-with-transparent-background.svg 'this is the title')

# Small size

Images with a small size are _not recommended_ to be used.

```
![the image alt text goes here](../../images/200.jpg)
```

![the image alt text goes here](../../images/200.jpg)

# Big height

Images with a big height are _not recommended_ to be used.

```
![the image alt text goes here](../../images/300x900.jpg)
```

![the image alt text goes here](../../images/300x900.jpg)

# Transparent background

Images without a transparent background should get a white background.

```
![the image alt text goes here](../../images/transparent-bkg.png)
```

![the image alt text goes here](../../images/transparent-bkg.png)

# Inline content

The following image is embedded into a body text paragraph. It will appear somehow on the page.

```
![the image alt text goes here](../../images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption')
```

The Image is after this text ![the image alt text goes here](../../images/1200x300.jpg 'The image title goes here and should be rendered as the caption') and before this text.

# External image

External images are _not recommended_ to be used but they should work as well and somehow do not look ugly.
