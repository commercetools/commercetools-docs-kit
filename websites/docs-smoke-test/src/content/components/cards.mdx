title: Cards
---

<Info>This describes variations that use the maximum extent of the feature set, all can be used with less and need to render</Info>

Cards typically need to be embedded into a flexbox-ish overflow wrapper that defines the responsive behavior and defines whether it's two aside or three aside if necessary.

 * All content including headings is markdown (blank lines needed but that has to be learnt for all components)
 * Headings have no linkable / hover anchor.
 * Headings can never become entries in the page index nav if used in a content page
 * `#` for the larger heading variant ("H3" in the design)?
 * `##` or higher levels for the smaller heading variant ("H4" in the design)?
 * Either an icon or an image path can be set, but not both. An Image is sized into the width of the card, an icon is sized into a fixed 48x48px square.
 * Cards can occur in two interaction variants, "active" (visually elevated) and "flat" (visually an outline only).


# Wrapper

```jsx
<Cards narrow>
  <Card>foo</Card>
  <Card>bar</Card>
  <Card>next row unless three aside (narrow) prop passed?</Card>
  <Card>next row in any case</Card>
</Cards>
```

## Pseudo-CSS:
```css
.cards {
	width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: stretch;
 }
.cards > * {
	flex-basis: 332px; /* the minimum width to never be three in a row */
	flex-grow: 1;
	flex-shrink: 1;
	/* No maximum width possible here in flexbox, i.e. there could be one card taking full width (not intended, but acceptable)
     Worth trying to abuse CSS grid as a single-row, auto-growing hack with explicit responsive breakpoints?
  */
}
.cards.narrow > * {
	flex-basis: 250px; /* the minimum width to never be four in a row */
}
```

## Output

<Cards>
  <Card>foo</Card>
  <Card>bar</Card>
  <Card>next row unless three aside prop passed?</Card>
  <Card>next row in any case</Card>
</Cards>

# Flat

Flat cards have one card-level link target (href) and can have other links in the content, too, or no linking at all.
The link target (href) is only useful if a link label for the bottom of the card is set.

## Flat with Image and Link

### MDX

```jsx
<Card
  href="/components/images"
  linkLabel="Read more about images..."
  image="/images/200.jpg">
## Example Small Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>
```

### Output

<Card
  href="/components/images"
  linkLabel="Read more about images..."
  image="/images/200.jpg">
## Example Small Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>

## Flat with Icon and no Link

### MDX

```jsx
<Card icon="/images/200.jpg">
# Example Large Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>
```
The `href` property can be set but will have no effect when neither `active` or `linkLabel` are set.

### Output

<Card icon="/images/200.jpg">
# Example Large Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>


# Active

Active cards have one card-level link target (href) and no other links in the content.
They are visually elevated and elevate even more when hovered.
The link target (href) can be repeated as a link at the bottom by setting a card link label.

## Active with Image and Link

### MDX

```jsx
<Card active
  href="/components/images"
  linkLabel="Read more about images..."
  image="/images/200.jpg">
# Example Large Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>
```

### Output

<Card active
  href="/components/images"
  linkLabel="Read more about images..."
  image="/images/200.jpg">
# Example Large Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>

## Active with Icon and no Link

### MDX

```jsx
<Card active
  href="/components/images"
  icon="/images/200.jpg">
## Example Small Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>
```

### Output

<Card active
  href="/components/images"
  icon="/images/200.jpg">
## Example Small Heading
This links to the images page and has an image and a read more link.
</Card>

# Embedded MDX in the Component Body

<Warning>this (really??) cannot be prevented but should not be used</Warning>

Since the MD(X) spec allows embedding markdown into JSX without a custom rendering by leaving blank lines, authors can use that pattern to place arbitrary article body content that would render in a way that is not card compatible.

If possible we should either embrace it or try to block it and warn the user.

### MDX

```jsx
<Card>

## Disallowed Subsection Heading
This would render like the full page body and should be prevented or not done

Even  | Tables |
------|--------|
would | work   |


</Card>
```

### Output

(breaks until implemented?)
