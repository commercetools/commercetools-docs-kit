title: Cards
---

 * The actual card content is markdown
 * Title have no linkable / hover anchor like section headings
 * Titles never become entries in the page index nav like section headings
 * Either an icon or an image path can be set, but not both.
   * To start with, Images are _not_ supported for free-form in-content cards, only in places that are fully designed and implemented by developers. An Image is sized into the width of the card.
   * Icons are supported anywhere but only those that are officially provided by the kit. An icon is sized into a fixed 48x48px square.
 * Cards can occur in two interaction variants, "active" (visually elevated) and "flat" (visually an outline only).
 * Cards must be embedded into a wrapper component that defines the responsive sizes (two aside / three aside) and parameters that must be identical in a give row or grid (active card area, the heading size)

# "Cards" Wrapper

 Properties (for authors):
 * `active` (boolean): if set, the whole area of all child cards is a link, the card is elevated and has a hover effect if a link url is set.
 * `narrow` (boolean): by default, two cards are shown side by side (except mobile viewports). if `narrow` is passed, the minimum card width is reduced so that three cards fit the content width on microsite landing pages.
 * `smallTitle` (boolean): lets all cards have a smaller

## Minimal form

```jsx
<Cards>
  <Card>foo</Card>
  <Card>bar</Card>
  <Card>next row unless three aside (narrow) prop passed?</Card>
  <Card>next row in any case</Card>
</Cards>
```
### Output

<Cards>
  <Card>foo</Card>
  <Card>bar</Card>
  <Card>next row unless three aside (narrow) prop passed?</Card>
  <Card>next row in any case</Card>
</Cards>


## All options configured

```jsx
<Cards active narrow smallTitle>
  <Card>foo</Card>
  <Card>bar</Card>
  <Card>next row unless three aside (narrow) prop passed?</Card>
  <Card>next row in any case</Card>
</Cards>
```

### Output

<Cards active narrow smallTitle>
  <Card>foo</Card>
  <Card>bar</Card>
  <Card>next row unless three aside (narrow) prop passed?</Card>
  <Card>next row in any case</Card>
</Cards>


## Pseudo-CSS:

This is for illustration. The implementation can be done differently. The design intent matches the CSS flexbox intent, but CSS grid might be more powerful although not originally being intended for rows with floating overflow.

```css
.cards {
	width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: stretch;
 }
.cards > * {
	flex-basis: 332px; /* the minimum width to never be three in a row */
	flex-grow: 1;
	flex-shrink: 1;
	/* No maximum width possible here in flexbox, i.e. there could be one card taking full width (not intended, but acceptable)  */
}
.cards.narrow > * {
	flex-basis: 250px; /* the minimum width to never be four in a row */
}
```

# "Card": the actual card

Properties (for authors):
 * `title` (string): the card title, no markdown allowed.
 * `href` (string): the link target of the bottom link and, if "active", the whole card. `href` has no effect when neither `active` or `link` are set.
 * `link` (string): the bottom link text. If not set, no bottom link is rendered at all.
 * `icon` (function): the component to be rendered into the 48x48px space reserved for an icon.  If not set, the space is not reserved.

## Flat with Link

```jsx
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="A regular heading"
    href="/components/images"
    link="Read more about images...">
  This is visually flat, has a link to the **images (bold)** page and only the link is a clickable target.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

### Output

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="A regular heading"
    href="/components/images"
    link="Read more about images...">
  This is visually flat, has a link to the **images (bold)** page and only the link is a clickable target.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Active with Link

<Info>Active cards must have a href set. If not that is an error condition in development mode</Info>

```jsx
<Cards active>
  <Card
    title="A regular heading"
    href="/components/images"
    link="Read more about images...">
  This is visually eleveated, has a link to the **images (bold)** page and the complete card is a clickable target.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

### Output

<Cards active>
  <Card
    title="A regular heading"
    href="/components/images"
    link="Read more about images...">
  This is visually elevated, has a link to the **images (bold)** page and the complete card is a clickable target.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Flat with Icon

This example assumes that the icon used here is already provided by the MDX provider anyways.  But since it's MDX, alternative or site-specific icons can be provided by adding an `import` statement in the MDX.

<Warning>

As discussed:
 * this would be the first place where authors have to learn more JSX syntax and not just the HTML-compatible subset.
 * Also, from an author experience perspective we need to be aware that referencing an icon that does not exist cannot be caught gracefully or dynamically but will cause a compilation error.

</Warning>

```jsx
<Cards smallTitle>
  <Card
    icon={Icon.ShoppingList}
    title="A smaller title">
    Example Text on a card with an icon.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

### Output

(no actual icon set until one is available to not break this page)

<Cards smallTitle>
  <Card
    icon={function(){}}
    title="A smaller title">
    Example Text on a card with an icon.
  </Card>
</Cards>

# Active

Active cards have one card-level link target (href) and no other links in the content.
They are visually elevated and elevate even more when hovered.
The link target (href) can be repeated as a link at the bottom by setting a card link label.

# Embedded MDX in the Component Body

The MDX spec and implementation allows for putting two blank lines to allow fully rendered markdown inside a JSX component. Because the cards must render markdown in the body differently than the same markdown would be rendered in the page body the implementation must either block the situation (e.g. detecting that the children aren't text but finished components) or override the renderer to use the MD fragment renderer instead.

```jsx
<Card>

## Disallowed Subsection Heading
This would render like the full page body and should be prevented or not done

Even  | Tables |
------|--------|
would | work   |


</Card>
```

## Output

(breaks the build until card is implemented)
