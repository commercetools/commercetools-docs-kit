# Ascenso Sports

[Earlier](/customer-management/customers#global-versus-store-specific-customers) in the module we looked at Ascenso Sports. Letâ€™s continue with them for this learning check.

When Ascenso Sports customers sign up as new members, they are associated to the _New-Members_ Customer Group automatically. Belonging to this Customer Group allows the new customers to enjoy a 10% discount on any product with their first purchase.

After customers have made their first purchase, Ascenso Sports would like to target all customers who have marked swimming and nordic walking in their interest area to increase sales of products for these sports. They would like to offer a 20% discount to these customers.

Your task is to go through the Customers one by one and assign them to a new Customer Group called _Swimming-Nordic-Walking_. Customers belonging to the _Swimming-Nordic-Walking_ Customer Group can thus enjoy a 20% discount on swimming and nordic walking products.
