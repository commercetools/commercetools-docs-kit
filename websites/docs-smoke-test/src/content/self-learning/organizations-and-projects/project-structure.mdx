After completing this page, you should be able to:

To build your Project structure Organizations, Projects, and Regions along with Teams and Users play an important role.
It's important for you to think about these as steps to follow when creating your commercetools' solution:

- First, you decide on a region for your e-commerce experience.
- Second, you create Organizations.
- Third, within each Organization you create Projects for your data.

# Project structure

When starting to work with Composable Commerce, you need to create your Project structure. Composable Commerce does not impose a particular Project structure on you - you can model Organizations, Teams, Projects, and Users according to your needs.
The relationships between these features are important to understand. Certain of these features are nested within other features:

- Organizations exist within Regions.
- Teams and Projects exist within Organizations.
- Users belong to Teams.

Let's take a closer look at the relationships between these features.

# Relationships between the features

Some of the most important relationships in Composable Commerce for us to understand are:

A Region can contain

- one or many Organizations.
- one or many Users.

A User

- belongs to at least one Team.
- can be in one or many Teams.

A Team

- can contain one or many Users.
- defines access permissions for one or many Projects.

An Organization can contain

- one or many Teams.
- multiple Projects.

A Project

- can have one or multiple Teams accessing it with different access permissions.

You will learn more about each of these features in more detail in the following pages, but for now it's enough for you to have a general understanding of how each of these is related to each other.

## A note about Regions

Before we move on, we need to talk about Regions. Regions are rarely mentioned in our discussions of Composable Commerce features. That's because a Region is not a resource within Composable Commerce. A Region is created and controlled by one of the major cloud providers - Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services, and all of the Composable Commerce resources reside there.

While there are multiple Regions where Composable Commerce is currently available, no data sharing happens between those Regions. If, for example, you create a User in the Google Cloud Europe Region, it has no access to any Composable Commerce resources or data in any other Region.

Composable Commerce is located within Cloud Regions around the world so you can choose one which is nearest to you to provide the lowest latency for your Composable Commerce API requests.

[Here is a list of Regions](/../api/general-concepts#regions) where Composable Commerce is currently available.

Before you begin creating your Projects, decide on the Region where you want to offer your services.
