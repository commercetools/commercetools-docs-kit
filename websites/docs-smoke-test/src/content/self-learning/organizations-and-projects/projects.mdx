After completing this page, you should be able to:

- Describe what a Project in Composable Commerce is.
- Create your own Project.

</Card>

A Project is a set of Product data and store configuration settings. You can also think of a Project as a data container for your commerce resources like Customers, Products, Carts, Orders, and Discounts.

Why do you need a data container? Composable Commerce is a multi-tenant commerce Software as a Service (SaaS) product. A Project provides for absolute data security within that multi-tenant environment. You can only access Project data with the respective permissions.
Learn more about Teams and Permissions [here](organizations-and-teams).

You may create more than one Project for various reasons based on your individual business needs. You may have individual Projects for development, testing, staging, and production. Composable Commerce does not force you to choose any specific topology.
Keep in mind that a Project can belong to one Organization only, but an Organization can have many Projects.

In this image above, we can see several Organizations belonging to one example company. Each Organization has one or more Projects and several distinct Teams. One Organization was created to create a trial Project. A second Organization contains a development and test Project, and a Third Organization contains the final Production Project. You can develop your Projects however you see fit.

We define access permissions for a Team to access a Project. Learn more about Teams and Permissions [here](organizations-and-teams).

## How can you create a Project?

You can only create Projects in the Merchant Center. To create a Project:

- as part of setting up your initial User account, [follow these steps](/../getting-started/initial-setup#create-your-first-project).
- after your User account has been created, [follow these steps](/../merchant-center/projects#create-a-project).

When you create a Project, you must define a Project key. This is a unique identifier that is used to identify the Project in every API call that you make. This, along with the scopes defined for your API Client will control programmatic access to the data contained in your Project.

Once your Project is created, you should [configure your Project settings](/../merchant-center/projects#configure-project-settings).

When you have created your Project, it will be in trial status for 60 days. You can see how much time is remaining in your trial in the Merchant Center in the [Manage Projects](/../merchant-center/projects#manage-projects) screen. You can also see if your Project is considered to be in production or not.

![Manage Projects page](images/organizations-and-projects/manage-projects-screenshot.png)

If a Project is not activated at the end of the 60-day trial, it is marked with a **Trial ended** flag. The Project data would be available in the Merchant Center, but you cannot obtain API tokens for the Project or make API calls.

The **In production** flag lets our Support team know that a Project is live and accepting traffic from customers. By default, this flag is deactivated for all Projects that are created.

To [activate a trial Project](/../merchant-center/projects#activate-a-trial-project) or to [mark a Project as in production](/../merchant-center/projects#mark-a-project-as-in-production), contact [our Support](https://support.commercetools.com/).
