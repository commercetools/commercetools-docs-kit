# Creating a proof-of-concept environment

You may remember that we previously mentioned some situations where you might want to use Composable Commerce. To remind you:

- You might be setting up a new ecommerce project for your company or client and need to create various organizational or project structures.
- You may be in charge of setting up a proof-of-concept for your company and if Composable Commerce is indeed the right solution.
- You may be tasked with setting commercetools up within your company and needing to onboard other staff in setting up their own projects or environments within Composable Commerce.
- You may be a developer who wants to explore Composable Commerce further.

Let’s look at the proof-of-concept scenario in a little more detail and think through how this might play out.

Imagine management has given you the task of investigating whether or not Composable Commerce is the right fit for your company’s e-commerce evolution. You think that the best way for you to really understand whether it’s the right fit or not is to actually start playing around with Composable Commerce. After reading through the getting started guide, and this module, you decide to set up a proof-of-concept environment for your company.

## What would be the best way for you to set up this Project?
