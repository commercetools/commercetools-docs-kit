title: Set up a new docs site
---

# Install and configure

A Docs-Kit website is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) project with at least the `@commercetools-docs/gatsby-theme-docs` Gatsby theme installed. The theme is providing not only the visual design but also all core functionality.

To create a new documentation website, create an empty folder and run the following commands to initialize a minimal setup (Node.js is assumed to be installed).

```console
npx install-peerdeps --dev @commercetools-docs/gatsby-theme-docs
mkdir src
```

This can take some time, creates a bare `package.json` file and downloads the dependencies.

Then create a file `gatsby-config.js` with the following content and modify the strings starting "change-" to your project name. The docs kit is preconfigured to host sites under a path prefix because one Gatsby website represents only one part (or "microsite") of the overall documentation.

```js
module.exports = {
  pathPrefix: '/change-path-prefix',
  siteMetadata: {
    title: 'CHANGE TITLE',
    description: 'CHANGE DESCRIPTION',
    products: ['CHOOSE PRODUCTS'],
    contentType: 'CHOOSE CONTENT TYPE',
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@commercetools-docs/gatsby-theme-docs',
      options: {
        websiteKey: 'change-website-key',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

# Start the local preview server

Now start the development server:

```console
npm exec gatsby develop
```

You will see the "404 Not Found" page of the development server because there is no page created yet.
The Docs-Kit has automatically created the conventional folder structure for you:

```
├── src
│   ├── content
│   │   ├── files
│   ├── images
│   └── data
└── static
    └── downloads
```

# Start writing pages

Now create a file `index.mdx` in the `src/content` folder and add some markdown content.
This is your home page and the only file named `index`.

All pages are served on a URL path that matches the filename inside `src/content` without the file extension. For example, `src/content/example-topic/example-page.mdx` in a page with path prefix `my-site` would be served as `/my-site/example-topic/example-page` in production.

All pages must be in MDX format.

# Next steps

Head on to the following documentation to complete your setup and writing skills:

- [Define the navigation menu](/writing/navigation)
- [Site and theme configuration](/configuration/theme)
- [File and folder structure](/writing/files-folders)

Of course, you also want to give your project the proper tooling and configuration that you give any Javascript project. As a minimum you should complete the `package.json` data, add a `.gitignore`, a `LICENSE` file, a `README.md`. Take a closer look at the root folder of the repository of the Docs-Kit, it has a lot more than needed in an average documentation site but you should find examples for most needs.

Finally, don't forget to [deploy](/configuration/deploy).
