Install the dependencies (uses yarn workspaces):

```bash
$ yarn
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test

# or
$ yarn test:watch
```

Build the packages

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Start the [docs-smoke-test website](./websites/docs-smoke-test):

```bash
$ cd websites/docs-smoke-test
$ yarn start
```

Start the [api-docs-smoke-test website](./websites/api-docs-smoke-test):

```bash
$ cd websites/api-docs-smoke-test
$ yarn start
```

When building a production or test site, setting an environment variable `ANALYZE_BUNDLE=true` starts a [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) based size analysis after the build. Keep in mind that the analysis only covers the JS content, GatsbyJS GraphQL data live in separate JSON files in the `/public/page-data` folder and are a source of page weight, too. The `/public/page-data/sq` subfolder contains the static query results.
