# Setup

Install the dependencies (uses yarn workspaces):

```bash
$ yarn
```

# Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test

# or
$ yarn test:watch
```

# Build the packages

```bash
$ yarn build
```

# Start Test Websites

Two websites hosted in this repository serve as the target if e2e and visual regression tests.

## Start the [docs-smoke-test website](./websites/docs-smoke-test):

```bash
$ cd websites/docs-smoke-test
$ yarn start
```

## Start the [api-docs-smoke-test website](./websites/api-docs-smoke-test):

```bash
$ cd websites/api-docs-smoke-test
$ yarn start
```

When building a production or test site, setting an environment variable `ANALYZE_BUNDLE=true` starts a [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) based size analysis after the build.
Keep in mind that the analysis only covers the JS content, GatsbyJS GraphQL data live in separate JSON files in the `/public/page-data` folder and are a source of page weight, too. The `/public/page-data/sq` subfolder contains the static query results.

To analyze memory issues, set an environment variable `DEBUG_GATSBY_MEM=true`. This forces a GC every second and prints process statistics.
Run on uncached builds for more insighful results.

To reduce to the minimum the memory usage in case of local development, set and environment variable `LOW_MEM=true`. In this way the development server runs in uncached mode.
