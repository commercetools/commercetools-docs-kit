In its simplest form, copy the contents of our [site template](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-docs-kit/tree/main/websites/site-template) into your existing javscript project and get started.

Replace all occurrences of "CHANGE ME" with your site's data and complete the settings in the `gatsby-config.js` file.

When activating theme extensions, don't forget to import the respective package in `package.json`.
