[Algolia docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) is the third party service we use to index and search our documentation. It is a hosted search API that allows you to integrate typo-tolerant search into websites.

## Crawler configuration

The crawler is the tool that indexes the documentation. It can be configured by changing the crawler script on the Algolia dashboard. A copy of The crawler script configuration is kept in the [docs-kit repo](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-docs-kit/blob/main/algolia-crawler.js). Enablement-team can change this script according to the requirements.

## Search tags definition

Algolia allows to filter the results by tags. The tags are defined in [this file](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-docs-kit/blob/main/packages/gatsby-theme-docs/src/components/advanced-search-filter.tsx#L17) in the docs-kit repo. They are currently hard coded meaning that adding/removing or editing a tag requires a new docs-kit release.

## Per site tags configuration

Each doc site can be associated to one or more tag. This is configured in the [metadata section of the site](/./configuration/theme#available-options-for-the-site-metadata). The `products` configuration is an array of strings that must match the tags definitions. If a site has a specific tag added in the `products` configuration, it means that any search perfomed with that specific tag selected, will include results from the site that matches the search string.

If no tags are configured, the site will be still included in the search results but only if no tag filtering is selected in the search interface.

Keep in mind that when selecting more tags in the search interface, will add them as OR conditions meaning that selecting more tags will not narrow down the search.

**Note**: In order to not assign any tag to a site, the `products` configuration must be configured line this `products: ['']`.

### Configuration examples:

Single tag:

```js
products: ['Frontend'],
```

Multiple tags:

```js
products: ['Frontend', 'Checkout'],
```

No tags:

```js
products: [''],
```
