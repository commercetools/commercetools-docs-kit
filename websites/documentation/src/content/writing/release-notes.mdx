Release note files can be found in `src/content/releases`. You can also place files in folders to better organize the release notes. The files follow a different specification and their location does not imply the URL. Hence, you can reorganize the files without changing the URL of the release note.

For more information on release notes, take a look at [typical example template](/releases/2021-12-31-title-of-the-release-note) or read the [specification by example file](/releases/2000-03-03-release-note-format-definition-custom) to learn the complete format.
