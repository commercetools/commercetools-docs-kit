title: Files and Folder Structure

# Folder Conventions

- `src/content`: this is where you would put your content pages as `*.mdx` files (_see [Writing content pages](/writing/pages)_).

- `src/content/files`: this folder should contain static files that can be referenced within the `*.mdx` content files. For example SVG files, PDF files, etc.

- `src/images`: this folder should contain images that are used within the `*.mdx` content files. Images in this folder are processed and optimized by Gatsby for lazy loading. Supported image formats are `JPEG` and `PNG`.

- `static`: this folder should contain files that do not need to be processed by Gatsby and will be served as-is. See [Gatsby static folder](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/static-folder/).<br/>
  Note that any `.html` file that is referenced as a link within the `*.mdx` content files is opened as a "static" HTML link, so when clicking on it the browser opens the link as a normal page.

- `static/downloads`: this folder should contain static files that can be referenced in the links within the `*.mdx` content files. All links starting with `/downloads` will be rendered as "static" HTML links, so when clicking on it the browser opens the link as a normal page.

# Special Files

- `src/data/navigation.yaml`: this contains the website main navigation links. The structure of the file is a _list of chapters_ as following:

  ```yaml
  - chapter-title: This is the title
    beta: false # (optional): will show the beta flag next to the chapter title
    pagination: false # (optional) hides the prev/next content pagination at the bottom of the pages in this chapter. Use for non-linear content like reference documentation.
    pages:
      - title: The first page
        path: '/chapter-1/first-page'
        beta: false # (optional): will show the beta flag next to the page title
      - title: Another page
        path: '/chapter-1/another-page'
      # another page, and so on...
  - chapter-title: {} # another chapter, and so on...
  ```
