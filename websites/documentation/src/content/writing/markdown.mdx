# Titles and headings

All content pages start with a title, followed by the subtitle and content. The title is defined using the `title` key in the frontmatter of the MDX file, followed by the subtitle, defined using the `<Subtitle>` tag.

```md
---
title: Title of the page
---

<Subtitle>

Short sentence with the main use case and benefits of the feature.

</Subtitle>

# Headers

You can use standard Markdown syntax for headings.

The first line of content is closely bound to the heading with a smaller margin. Heading levels 1,2, and 3 appear in the right-hand index navigation by default, which helps readers understand the page's content without reading or scrolling through them.

# Level 1 heading

They have the biggest font than other headings, and bound to the left margin of the page.

## Level 2 heading

They have a smaller font than the level 1 headings, and are also bound to the left margin of the page.

### Level 3 heading

They have the smallest font compared to the other headings, and are slightly indented to th right from the left margin of the page.

#### Level 4 heading

Any headings after level 3 are rendered and aligned the same as level 3 headings, but do not appear on the right-hand index navigation as level 3 headings.
```

The rendered page can be seen [here](/writing/sample).

<Warning>
Avoid using links, code formatting, or any other style in headings.

## Tables

We strongly prefer bulleted lists to tables for consistency, visual styling, and Markdown formatting reasons.

<SideBySide>

# Special mentions

Special mentions are limited to Info or Warning boxes in our documentation. Place them (before or after a sentence) in relevance to the context being discussed for better clarity. Limit the usage of notices, to where necessary, to avoid reducing its effectiveness in emphasizing important information.

- **Info box**

  <Info>

  An Info box is used to:

  - emphasize points or reminders.
  - point out exceptions from the standard behavior described in the respective section.
  - indicate possible side effects that are not obvious or expected in the first place.

  </Info>

- **Warning box**

  <Warning>

  A Warning box is used to warn users about the possibility of issues or data loss.

  </Warning>

When using Markdown syntax within, leave an empty line between the content and element tags for the formatting to render.

# Cards

<Warning>

_Writers - Check links/image path when migrated._

</Warning>

A card, by default, is flat and of regular width. Two regular cards and three narrow cards can be stacked side by side (except in mobile viewports) in microsite landing pages. You can also use a narrow card of reduced width by passing `narrow` in the syntax. It is also possible to make these cards clickable by passing `clickable` in the syntax.

<Warning>

_Writers - What are the use cases. Use cases to be documented in templates too._

</Warning>

- Flat - _Use case_
- Clickable - _Use case_
- Regular - _Use case_
- Narrow - _Use case_

The following properties can be used to define the content within the card:

- `fitContentColumn` (boolean): automatically set to cards on landing pages. However, it is rendered differently for cards used in content pages.
  <Warning>

  _Writers / Nikolaus - What does this parameter do exactly? The current information doesn't say much as to what it does._

  </Warning>

- `title` (string): use to set a title for a card, no Markdown allowed.(Does "no markdown" mean that formatting isn't applicable?)
  - `smallTitle` (boolean): use to reduce and set a smaller font size to card titles.
- `textLink` (string): use to set the bottom link text. If not set, the bottom link is not rendered at all.
- `href` (string): use to set the target of the bottom link and whole card (if `clickable` is set). If `clickable` or `textLink` isn't set, `href` has no effect.
- `icon` (component): use to reserve a 48x48px space for an icon in the card.
- `image` (component): use to reserve a `define pixels` space for an image in the card.

## Cards with no properties defined

This is an example of a set of cards with no properties defined. It is flat and of regular width as the parameters `clickable` and `narrow` are not defined. It only contains the body as `title` is not defined.

```jsx
<Cards>
  <Card>Card A</Card>
  <Card>Card B</Card>
  <Card>Card C</Card>
  <Card>Card D</Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
  <Card>Card A</Card>
  <Card>Card B</Card>
  <Card>Card C</Card>
  <Card>Card D</Card>
</Cards>

### Cards with a list in the body

It is also possible to have a list in the body of the card. Lists are usually used in flat cards as you can provide multiple target links for multiple list entries, which is not the case for [clickable cards](#clickable-card) that have only one target link.

<Warning>

_Writers - Is the above paragraph right?_

</Warning>

```jsx
<Cards>
  <Card title="Card with bullet list">
    - Item 1 - Item 2 - Sub-item 1 - Item 3
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
<Card title="Card with bullet list">

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
- Item 3

</Card>
</Cards>

## Cards with a link

### Flat card

```jsx
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation"
  >
    In a flat card, only the target link is clickable.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation"
  >
    In a flat card, only the target link is clickable.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Clickable card

<Info>
Clickable cards must have a href set.
</Info>

They have one card-level target link (href) and no other links in the content. The target link (href) can be repeated as a link at the bottom by setting a card link label.

```jsx
<Cards clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation"
  >
    In a clickable card, the complete card is a clickable target.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation">In a clickable card, the complete card is a clickable target.</Card>
</Cards>

<Warning>

_Writers - What is the use of the link text if the card and link text have the same target link?_

</Warning>

## Cards with an image

Images are not supported for free-form in-content cards, but only in places that are fully designed and implemented by developers. An image is sized into the width of the card.

<Warning>

_Writers / Nikolaus_
  - _What does the above information mean?_
  - _Why aren't images/icons not rendered? Am I missing something?_

</Warning>

### Flat card

```jsx
<Cards>
<Card
  title="Title of the card"
  image={<CardBannerOSSIcon />}
>
  Flat card with an image
</Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
<Card
  title="Title of the card"
  image={<CardBannerOSSIcon />}

  Flat card with an image
</Card>
</Cards>

### Clickable card

```jsx
<Cards clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    image={<CardBannerMcDevsIcon />}
  >
    Clickable card with an image
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    image={<CardBannerMcDevsIcon />}>
    Clickable card with an image
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Cards with an icon

<Info>

Only icons provided in the [UI Kit](https://uikit.commercetools.com/?path=/story/components-icons--all-icons) are supported. They fit in a 48x48px square aligned at the top or left of a card.

</Info>

### Flat card

```jsx
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    icon={<DummyIcon />}
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about images"
  >
    Icons in regular cards are aligned to the top regardless of whether they are
    clickable or flat.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

    title="Title of the card"
    icon={<DummyIcon />}
    href="/writing/navigation"

</Cards>

### Clickable card

```jsx
<Cards narrow clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about images"
    icon={<DummyIcon />}

    Icons in narrow cards are aligned to the left regardless of whether they are
