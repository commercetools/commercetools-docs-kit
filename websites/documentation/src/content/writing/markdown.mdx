# Frontmatter, Title

Content pages typically have a title, followed by the subtitle and content.
The title is defined using the `title` key in the frontmatter of the MDX file.
"Frontmatter" is a block of `yaml` syntax data properties at the top of an MDX file, enclosed by lines with three minus-dash signs.

followed by the subtitle, defined using the `<Subtitle>` tag.

# Headings

You can use standard Markdown syntax for headings.

The first line of content is closely bound to the heading with a smaller margin.
Heading levels 1,2, and 3 appear in the right-hand index navigation by default, which helps readers understand the page's content without reading or scrolling through them.

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
# Level 1 heading

They have the biggest font than other headings, and bound to the left margin of the page.

## Level 2 heading

They have a smaller font than the level 1 headings, and are also bound to the left margin of the page.

### Level 3 heading

They have the smallest font compared to the other headings, and are slightly indented to th right from the left margin of the page.

#### Level 4 heading

Any headings after level 3 are rendered and aligned the same as level 3 headings, but do not appear on the right-hand index navigation as level 3 headings.
```

_(no preview for headings in the docs, would break the page layout)_

</SideBySide>

The rendered page can be seen [here](/writing/sample).

<Warning>
Avoid using links, code formatting, or any other style in headings.

## Monospaced Text

Monospaced Text is to be used for string literals, that is cases where the communication is not intended by the meaning of the word but to be the exact character sequence as displayed.
Typical examples are inline code spans like shell commands, file names, folder paths, but also constant values.

# Special mentions

Special mentions are limited to Info or Warning boxes in our documentation.
Place them (before or after a sentence) in relevance to the context being discussed for better clarity.
Limit the usage of notices, to where necessary, to avoid reducing its effectiveness in emphasizing important information.

When using Markdown syntax within, you must leave an empty line between the content and element tags for the formatting to render.
Nearly all Markdown is possible inside Special Mentions but only text microformatting and lists are recommended.

## Info box

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
<Info>

An Info box is used to:

- emphasize points or reminders.
- point out exceptions from the standard behavior described in the respective section.
- indicate possible side effects that are not obvious or expected in the first place.

</Info>
```

# Links

Link URLs have to follow a defined convention depending on whether they point to the same microsite, a different docs-kit microsite or to an external location.
They are rendered differently based on the target and analytics tracking is added depending on the target.

## Link to an external website

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
[Link to commercetools' marketing website](https://commercetools.com)
```

<Card>[Link to commercetools' marketing website](https://commercetools.com)</Card>

</SideBySide>

## Link to a heading or other anchor on the same page

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme

```

<Card>[how to write links](#links)</Card>

</SideBySide>

## Link to another page on this site

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme

[writing pages - markdown frontmatter section](/writing/pages#markdown-frontmatter)
```

<Card>
[writing pages](/writing/pages)
[writing pages - markdown frontmatter section](/writing/pages#markdown-frontmatter)
</Card>

</SideBySide>

## Link to a page of another docs microsite

<Info>
This special  `/../` notation is important to remember because it is a special feature of the docs-kit.
It's a valid URL but not a common or useful type of link target outside the concept of path prefixed microsites.
</Info>

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
[A link to the '/views/links' path in the `docs-smoke-test` microsite](/../docs-smoke-test/views/links)
```

<Card>[A link to the '/views/links' path in the `docs-smoke-test` microsite](/../docs-smoke-test/views/links)</Card>

</SideBySide>

Technically, this is navigation into a "negative" path depth. In development mode this will not be working link target, but in production the site is hosted inside a subfolder of the main domain, so this pattern is navigating out of the current website into the main domain and then into the other microsite.

## Link to static files

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
[Link](/downloads/hello.txt)
```

[Link](/downloads/hello.txt)

</SideBySide>

# Custom link targets

The `<Anchor>` component allows to create invisible link targets at any place in the content.
It allows to create links to places that are not a heading - headings have an autogenerated "anchor" to link to them.

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
[This link jumps to the anchored line.](#any-html-id-compatible-string-expected-usage)

The anchor is placed in this text line. <Anchor name="any-html-id-compatible-string-expected-usage" />

### The anchor is placed in this title <Anchor name="any-html-id-compatible-string-in-a-title" />

- Item 1 <Anchor name="any-html-id-compatible-string-in-a-list" />
- Item 2
```

<Card>

[This link jumps to the anchored line.](#any-html-id-compatible-string-expected-usage)

The anchor is placed in this line. <Anchor name="any-html-id-compatible-string-expected-usage"/>

_titles can't be previewed here without breaking the page flow_

- Item 1 <Anchor name="any-html-id-compatible-string-in-a-list" />
- Item 2

</Card>

</SideBySide>

# Cards

A card, by default, is flat and of regular width. Two regular cards and three narrow cards can be stacked side by side (except in mobile viewports) in microsite landing pages. You can also use a narrow card of reduced width by passing `narrow` in the syntax. It is also possible to make these cards clickable by passing `clickable` in the syntax.

- Flat - _Use case_
- Clickable - _Use case_
- Regular - _Use case_
- Narrow - _Use case_

The following properties can be used to define the content within the card:

- `fitContentColumn` (boolean): automatically set to cards on landing pages. However, it is rendered differently for cards used in content pages.

- `title` (string): use to set a title for a card, no Markdown allowed.(Does "no markdown" mean that formatting isn't applicable?)
  - `smallTitle` (boolean): use to reduce and set a smaller font size to card titles.
- `textLink` (string): use to set the bottom link text. If not set, the bottom link is not rendered at all.
- `href` (string): use to set the target of the bottom link and whole card (if `clickable` is set). If `clickable` or `textLink` isn't set, `href` has no effect.
- `icon` (component): use to reserve a 48x48px space for an icon in the card.
- `image` (component): use to reserve a `define pixels` space for an image in the card.

## Cards with no properties defined

This is an example of a set of cards with no properties defined. It is flat and of regular width as the parameters `clickable` and `narrow` are not defined. It only contains the body as `title` is not defined.

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
<Cards>
  <Card>Card A</Card>
  <Card>Card B</Card>
  <Card>Card C</Card>
  <Card>Card D</Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
  <Card>Card A</Card>
  <Card>Card B</Card>
  <Card>Card C</Card>
  <Card>Card D</Card>
</Cards>

</SideBySide>

### Cards with a list in the body

It is also possible to have a list in the body of the card. Lists are usually used in flat cards as you can provide multiple target links for multiple list entries, which is not the case for [clickable cards](#clickable-card) that have only one target link.

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
<Cards>
  <Card title="Card with bullet list">
    - Item 1 - Item 2 - Sub-item 1 - Item 3
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
<Card title="Card with bullet list">

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
- Item 3

</Card>
</Cards>

</SideBySide>

## Cards with a link

### Flat card

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation"
  >
    In a flat card, only the target link is clickable.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation"

  </Card>
</Cards>

</SideBySide>

### Clickable card

<Info>
Clickable cards must have an href set.
</Info>

They have one card-level target link (href) and no other links in the content. The target link (href) can be repeated as a link at the bottom by setting a card link label.

<SideBySide>

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme
<Cards clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation"
  >
    In a clickable card, the complete card is a clickable target.
  </Card>
</Cards>
```

<Cards clickable>
  <Card
    title="Title of the card"
    href="/writing/navigation"
    textLink="Read more about navigation">In a clickable card, the complete card is a clickable target.</Card>
</Cards>

</SideBySide>

## Cards with an image

Images are not supported for free-form in-content cards, but only in places that are fully designed and implemented by developers. An image is sized into the width of the card.
