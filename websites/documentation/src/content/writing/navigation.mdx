# Top navigation

The top navigation entries can be modified in `packages/gatsby-theme-docs/src/data/top-menu.yaml`.

# Side navigation

The left-hand navigation allows you to navigate different pages in the microsite, while the right-hand navigation allows you to navigate within a page. You can organize the pages shown in the left-hand navigation in `/src/data/navigation.yaml`.

Left-hand navigation supports up to three levels of nesting, meaning that you can define Chapters containing either pages or Subchapters. This is an example of how a 3 levels navigation is structured in the `navigation.yaml` file:

```yaml

- chapter-title: Subchapters
  pages:
    - title: Subchapter One
      pages:
        - title: third level page 1
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-five
        - title: third level page 2
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-six
        - title: third level page 3
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-seven
    - title: Normal Chapter 1
      path: /empty-pages/empty-page-twelve
    - title: Normal Chapter 2
      path: /empty-pages/empty-page-thirteen
    - title: Normal Chapter 3
      path: /empty-pages/empty-page-fourteen
    - title: Subchapter Two
      pages:
        - title: third level page 1
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-nine
        - title: third level page 2
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-ten
        - title: third level page 3
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-eleven

```

The above configuration will generate the following menu layout:

# Child section navigation

As the name suggests, it is a navigator within a section that is used to shorten the right-hand navigation. It condenses headings (from level 3 to 6) and displays them within this section, rather than the right-hand navigation. Hierarchy can be represented by adding additional `#`. It supports one level of hierarchy inside the child section navigator. Deeper nesting is not recommended and rendered as the second level.

This is the syntax `<ChildSectionsNav parent="a-section-slug" />` to add the navigation.

`<ChildSectionsNav parent="child-section-example" />` is rendered as [shown here](/writing/sample#child-section-example).

At commercetools, we typically use the child section navigation in _Representations_ and _Update Actions_ of resource pages. As the list can be long in some cases, use `navLevels` and set to `2` in the frontmatter of the MDX file. This displays only upto level 2 headings in the right-hand index navigation of the page.

<Warning>
Adding the flag removes all level 3 headings in a page from the right-hand index navigation.
</Warning>
