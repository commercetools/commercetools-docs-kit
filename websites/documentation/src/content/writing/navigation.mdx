# Top navigation

The top navigation entries can be modified in `packages/gatsby-theme-docs/src/data/top-menu.yaml`.

Here is an example of top-menu structure:

```yaml
- menu-title: All products
  icon: package
  items:
    - title: Composable Commerce
      items:
        - label: APIs
          items:
            - title: HTTP APIs
              href: /views/empty
            - title: GraphQL APIs
              href: /views/empty
            - title: Import & Export APIs
              href: /views/empty
```

Top menu supports a nesting of up to 3 levels.

**First** level can have the following attribute:

- `menu-title`: The title text
- `icon`: a string referencing an existing [lord-icon](/writing/lord-icons) icon
- `href`: if the menu item is a direct link to a page, href should contain the url of the page
- `items`: if the menu item contains sub-items, this property should contain the list of sub items

**Second and third** levels can have the following attrinutes

- `title`: The title text
- `href`: if the menu item is a direct link to a page, href should contain the url of the page
- `items`: if the menu item contains sub-items, this property should contain the list of sub items
- `label`: If defined with a child `items` property. It will display a list of items under a bold text label

Top menu also supports items to appear in the bottom area of the menu. Bottom items **don't** support any nesting.

**Bottom area** items can have the following attrinutes

- `footer-title`: The title text
- `icon`: a string referencing an existing [lord-icon](/writing/lord-icons) icon
- `href`: if the menu item is a direct link to a page, href should contain the url of the page

# Side navigation

The left-hand navigation allows you to navigate different pages in the microsite, while the right-hand navigation allows you to navigate within a page. You can organize the pages shown in the left-hand navigation in `/src/data/navigation.yaml`.

# Child section navigation

As the name suggests, it is a navigator within a section that is used to shorten the right-hand navigation. It condenses headings (from level 3 to 6) and displays them within this section, rather than the right-hand navigation. Hierarchy can be represented by adding additional `#`. It supports one level of hierarchy inside the child section navigator. Deeper nesting is not recommended and rendered as the second level.

This is the syntax `<ChildSectionsNav parent="a-section-slug" />` to add the navigation.

`<ChildSectionsNav parent="child-section-example" />` is rendered as [shown here](/writing/sample#child-section-example).

At commercetools, we typically use the child section navigation in _Representations_ and _Update Actions_ of resource pages. As the list can be long in some cases, use `navLevels` and set to `2` in the frontmatter of the MDX file. This displays only upto level 2 headings in the right-hand index navigation of the page.

<Warning>
Adding the flag removes all level 3 headings in a page from the right-hand index navigation.
</Warning>
