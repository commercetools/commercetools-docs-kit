# Top navigation

The top navigation entries can be modified in `packages/gatsby-theme-docs/src/data/top-menu.yaml`.

Here is an example of top-menu structure:

```yaml
- menu-title: All products
  icon: package
  items:
    - title: Composable Commerce
      items:
        - label: APIs
          items:
            - title: HTTP APIs
              href: /views/empty
            - title: GraphQL APIs
              href: /views/empty
            - title: Import & Export APIs
              href: /views/empty
```

![top-menu example](/images/top-menu-example.png 'Top menu layout generated by the above sample code')

Top menu supports a nesting of up to 3 levels.

**First** level can have the following attribute:

- `menu-title`: The title text
- `icon`: a string referencing an existing [lord-icon](/writing/lord-icons) icon
- `href`: if the menu item is a direct link to a page, href should contain the url of the page
- `items`: if the menu item contains sub-items, this property should contain the list of sub items

**Second and third** levels can have the following attrinutes

- `title`: The title text
- `href`: if the menu item is a direct link to a page, href should contain the url of the page
- `items`: if the menu item contains sub-items, this property should contain the list of sub items
- `label`: If defined with a child `items` property. It will display a list of items under a bold text label

**Note**

In each column, expandable items are automatically displayed as first items followed by the non expandable ones (direct link), regardless of how they are defined in the `top-menu.yaml` file.

Children items of a `label` must be all direct links, we don't support expandable items as label children.

Top menu also supports items to appear in the bottom area of the menu. Bottom items **don't** support any nesting.

**Bottom area** items can have the following attrinutes

- `footer-title`: The title text
- `icon`: a string referencing an existing [lord-icon](/writing/lord-icons) icon
- `href`: if the menu item is a direct link to a page, href should contain the url of the page

# Side navigation

The left-hand navigation allows you to navigate different pages in the microsite, while the right-hand navigation allows you to navigate within a page. You can organize the pages shown in the left-hand navigation in `/src/data/navigation.yaml`.

Left-hand navigation supports up to three levels of nesting, meaning that you can define Chapters containing either pages or Subchapters. This is an example of how a 3 levels navigation is structured in the `navigation.yaml` file:

```yaml
- chapter-title: Subchapters
  pages:
    - title: Subchapter One
      pages:
        - title: third level page 1
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-five
        - title: third level page 2
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-six
        - title: third level page 3
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-seven
    - title: Normal Chapter 1
      path: /empty-pages/empty-page-twelve
    - title: Normal Chapter 2
      path: /empty-pages/empty-page-thirteen
    - title: Normal Chapter 3
      path: /empty-pages/empty-page-fourteen
    - title: Subchapter Two
      pages:
        - title: third level page 1
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-nine
        - title: third level page 2
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-ten
        - title: third level page 3
          path: /empty-pages/empty-page-eleven
```

The above configuration will generate the following menu layout:

# Footer navigation

The footer navigation entries can be modified in `packages/gatsby-theme-docs/src/data/footer.yaml`.

Here is an example of the footer structure:

```yaml
- menu-title: Documentation
  items:
    - label: Docs Kit Docs
      href: /../documentation

- menu-title: Test Sites
  items:
    - label: Docs Smoke Test
      href: /../docs-smoke-test
    - label: API Docs Smoke Test
      href: /../api-docs-smoke-test
    - label: Self-learning Smoke Test
      href: /../self-learning-smoke-test

- menu-title: Product with long title
  items:
    - label: Getting started
      href: /
    - label: APIs
      href: /
```

You can also adjust the links below the footer in `packages/gatsby-theme-docs/src/data/footer-links.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
- label: Privacy Policy
  href: https://commercetools.com/privacy
- label: Cookies
  href: https://commercetools.com/privacy#1.2
- label: Imprint
  href: https://commercetools.com/imprint
```

# Child section navigation

As the name suggests, it is a navigator within a section that is used to shorten the right-hand navigation. It condenses headings (from level 3 to 6) and displays them within this section, rather than the right-hand navigation. Hierarchy can be represented by adding additional `#`. It supports one level of hierarchy inside the child section navigator. Deeper nesting is not recommended and rendered as the second level.

This is the syntax `<ChildSectionsNav parent="a-section-slug" />` to add the navigation.

`<ChildSectionsNav parent="child-section-example" />` is rendered as [shown here](/writing/sample#child-section-example).

At commercetools, we typically use the child section navigation in _Representations_ and _Update Actions_ of resource pages. As the list can be long in some cases, use `navLevels` and set to `2` in the frontmatter of the MDX file. This displays only upto level 2 headings in the right-hand index navigation of the page.

<Warning>
Adding the flag removes all level 3 headings in a page from the right-hand index navigation.
</Warning>
