# Images

You can use regular Markdown syntax to display images. Since the site generator automatically optimizes images, it is not necessary to adjust them in concerns of file size, resolution, and so on.

- You can add a caption to images by following the Markdown syntax.
- Images with a transparent background (PNG) would have a white background.
- SVG images are not handled by Gatsby, but would still be rendered.
