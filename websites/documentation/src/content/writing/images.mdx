You can find all images in `/src/images`, and can use standard Markdown syntax to insert images. It is good to have a meaningful image names and alt text when using images. A meaningful alt text is useful for visually impaired users using softwares to read text on a page. Also, a meaningful image name with keywords helps with SEO.

The site generator automatically optimizes images, hence, it's not necessary to adjust them in concerns of file size, resolution, and so on.

- You can add a caption to images by following the Markdown syntax.
- Images with a transparent background (PNG) would have a white background.
- SVG images are not handled by Gatsby, but would still be rendered.
