# commercetools learning gatsby plugin

A gatsby theme plugins providing UI components and helper utilities to integrate self-learning functionality.

Works against commercetools' learning-api, which is not a part of this open source project.

## Configuration

`gatsby-theme-learning` plugin expects the following parameters and also needs the [`gatsby-theme-sso-ui-kit`](../configuration/sso)

- `auth0Domain`: the auth0 application domain url (it is defined in the auth0 management app)
- `learnApiBaseUrl`: the learn API base url. It can be omitted if the host running the site matches the api host.
- `features`: an array of strings representing feature flags used to toggle specific functionalities. Expected values:
  - `status-indicator`: feature flag to toggle the course status indicator.

In order to enable the plugin, the following configuration should be added to the `gatsby-config.js` plugin section:

```
{
    resolve: '@commercetools-docs/gatsby-theme-learning',
    options: {
        auth0Domain: 'auth0domain.dummy.tld',
        learnApiBaseUrl: 'https://api.host.tld',
    },
}
```

## Components

### Quiz

Quiz component can be used in any `mdx` page. It's responsible for fetching, rendering and handling all the interaction logic of a quiz answer submission.
The component simply renders a login CTA if the user is not logged in, otherwise the quiz is rendered.

The component expects 2 mandatory props:

- `courseId`: Id of the course defined in the LMS
- `quizId`: Id of the quiz defined in the LMS

Example


```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme

<Quiz courseId="5565" quizId="85065"/>

```

### IfUserLoggedIn / IfUserLoggedOut

These component are used to wrap content that should only be displayed if the user is logged in or logged out respectively.

Examples

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme

<IfUserLoggedIn>
 ## Welcome back!
</IfUserLoggedIn>

```

```md title="you write:" secondaryTheme

<IfUserLoggedOut>
 ## Please log in
</IfUserLoggedOut>

```
