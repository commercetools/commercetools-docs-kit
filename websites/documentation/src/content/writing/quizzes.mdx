# commercetools learning plugin

A gatsby theme plugins providing UI components and helper utilities to integrate self-learning functionality
into other React User interfaces.

Works against commercetools' learning-api, which is not a part of this open source project. 

## Configuration

`gatsby-theme-learning` plugin expects 2 parameters and also needs the [`gatsby-theme-sso-ui-kit`](../configuration/sso)

- `auth0Domain`: the auth0 application domain url (it is defined in the auth0 management app)
- `learnApiBaseUrl`: the learn API base url. It can be omitted if the host running the site matches the api host.

In order to enable the plugin, the following configuration should be added to the `gatsby-config.js` plugin section:

```
{
    resolve: '@commercetools-docs/gatsby-theme-learning',
    options: {
        auth0Domain: 'auth0domain.dummy.tld',
        learnApiBaseUrl: 'https://api.host.tld',
    },
}
```

## Components

### Quiz

Quiz component can be used in any `mdx` page. It's responsible for fetching, rendering and handling all the interaction logic of a quiz answer submission.
The component simply renders a login CTA if the user is not logged in, otherwise the quiz is rendered.

The component expects 2 mandatory props:

- `courseId`: Id of the course defined in Moodle LMS
- `quizId`: Id of the quiz defined in Moodle LMS

Example
