# Headers

You can use standard Markdown syntax for headings.

The first line of content is bound to the heading with a smaller margin. Heading levels 1,2, and 3 appear in the right-hand index navigation by default, which helps readers understand the page's content without reading or scrolling through them.

# Level 1 heading

They have the biggest font than other headings, and bound to the left margin of the page.

## Level 2 heading

They have a smaller font than the level 1 headings, and are also bound to the left margin of the page.

### Level 3 heading

They have the smallest font compared to the other headings, and are slightly indented to th right from the left margin of the page.

#### Level 4 heading

Any headings after level 3 are rendered and aligned the same as level 3 headings, but do not appear on the right-hand index navigation as level 3 headings.

# Child section example

<ChildSectionsNav parent="child-section-example"/>
