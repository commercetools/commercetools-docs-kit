title: Multiple paths
---

Using `MultiPathBlock` component you can create a block of content with multiple paths. Each path is selectable by clicking on the corresponding tab at the top of the block.

This component is useful when, for example, we want to display different information and code example depending on a specific language or application. Opposed to the `MultiCodeBlock` which can only display code, `MultiPathBlock` can display any type of content (with certain caveats).

Furthermore, the `MultiPathBlock` component can "sync" the selected tab automatically with any other `MultiPathBlock` or `MultiCodeBlock` components. This means that when you click on a tab in one block, the corresponding tab in the other block will be selected as well and that choice is rememberer when navigating between pages.

## Syntax

The `MultiPathBlock` tag must contain **two** or **more** `<PathBlock>` tags. Each `<PathBlock>` tag represents a tab in the block.

The `label` prop is used to define the text of the tab and it's mandatory.

The `syncWith` prop is used to define a string (typically a programming language or a application name) that will be used to keep the tabs in sync with other `MultiPathBlock` or `MultiCodeBlock` components. If the `syncWith` prop is not defined, the tab will not trigger any sync with other components.


### Caveats

The content of the `<PathBlock>` tag can be any type of content, including markdown, code examples, custom components. An extensive example can be found [here](/../docs-smoke-test/views/multi-path-block). However, there are few caveats:

- **Do not use any headings** as it will break the side page navigation that is constructed based on the headings.

- **Do not use SiteBySide** component as it will not render correctly.

- Breaking lines can **only** be done using the html `<br/>` tag. The markdown syntax for breaking lines will not work.

- The sync mechanism between blocks is based on the exact match of the language string (case insensitive). Meaning that `js` and `javascript` are considered different languages. Keep it in mind when defining the `syncWith` prop.

### Reccomendations

One of the most common doubts is when to use `MultiPathBlock` and when to use `MultiCodeBlock`. The rule of thumb is to use `MultiPathBlock` when you want to display content that is not **only** code, for example some markdown content that explains in details the code and it's different for each tab.

````jsx

<MultiPathBlock>
<PathBlock label="Javascript" syncWith="javascript">

Below you can see and example of how to write **debug messages** in `JavaScript`.
</br>

```javascript
console.log('this is it in javascript');
```
<br/>

You can use `console.log` functions whenever you want to print something to the console.

</PathBlock>
<PathBlock label="PHP" syncWith="php">

Below you can see and example of how to write debug messages using `PHP`.
<br/>

```php
print('this is it in php');
```
<br/>

You can use `print` function whenever you want to print something to the standard output.

</PathBlock>
<PathBlock label="Other languages">

When **this tab** is selected, it should not trigger any sync with other `MultiPathBlock` components.
<br/>

The reason is that the `<PathBlock>` component does not have the `syncWith` prop defined. This could be useful when you want to display content that is not related specifically to any other contents displayed in `MultiPathBlock` components.

</PathBlock>
</MultiPathBlock>


## Example of MultiCodeBlock syncing with MultiPathBlock

Below you find a `MultiCodeBlock` that syncs with the above defined `MultiPathBlock` components and vice versa.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```javascript
  let name = "John";
  let greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
  console.log(greeting);
```

```php
<?php
$name = "John";
$greeting = "Hello, " . $name . "!";
echo $greeting;
?>
```

```java
String selectedLanguage = "en";
selectedLanguage = "fr";
System.out.println(selectedLanguage);
selectedLanguage = selectedLanguage.toUpperCase();
```

```TypeScript
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
function greet(name: string): void {
    console.log(`${message} Welcome, ${name}.`);
}
greet("Alice");
```

</MultiCodeBlock>
<br/>

Note that the `Java` code is not synced with the `MultiPathBlock` components. This is because the `Java` code is not part of the `MultiPathBlock` component.
