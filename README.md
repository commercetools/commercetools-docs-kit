This repository contains packages to develop documentation websites for commercetools. It includes things like Gatsby themes, Gatsby plugins, UI components, etc. Please look at the individual packages in [`packages` folder](./packages) for functional documentation.

## Getting started

For general documentation use cases, start with the [base theme](./packages/gatsby-theme-docs). The [`packages` folder](./packages) also includes [base theme](./packages/gatsby-theme-docs) addons that you may find useful.

For documention based on API specifications, start with the [API theme](./packages/gatsby-theme-api-docs). Note that the [API theme](./packages/gatsby-theme-api-docs) is also an addon to the [base theme](./packages/gatsby-theme-docs).

## Developing packages

Install the dependencies (uses yarn workspaces):

```bash
$ yarn
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test

# or
$ yarn test:watch
```

Build the packages

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Start the [docs-smoke-test website](./websites/docs-smoke-test):

```bash
$ yarn start
```
## Vercel configuration

Vercel does not automatically detect this repository as a GatsbyJS project due to the custom build that merges multiple gatsbyJS sites into one folder.
To enable caching and incremental builds the "Framework preset" needs to be done manually in the Vercel backend. For caching, the `prebuild` and `postbuild` scripts are moving the respective folders from the microsites to the root cache and public folders.
